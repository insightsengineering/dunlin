## Introduction

Reformatting in `dulin` consists in replacing predetermined values by another in particular variables for selected
tables of a data set stored.

This is performed in two steps: 

1. A rule (`list`) is created which specifies the correspondence between the old and the new values

2. The reformatting itself is performed with the `dunlin::reformat()` function.

## The Rule Structure

The rule is a `list`.
Its names are the new values to be used, and its values are the old values to be used.

```{r}
list(A = "a", B = c("c", "d"))
```

Using this rule will replace "a" with "A", replace "c" or "d" with "B".

## Calling `reformat`

`reformat` is a generic supports reformatting of `character`, `factor`, `dm` and `list of data.frame`. Reformatting for
other types of variables is meaningless. `reformat` will also preserve the attributes of the
original data, e.g. the data type or labels will be unchanged.

An example of reformatting `character` can be
```{r}
r <- list(A = "a", B = c("c", "d"))
reformat(c("a", "c", "d", NA), r)
```

We can see that the `NA` values are not changed.

Now we test the factor reformatting:
```{r}
r <- list(A = "a", B = c("c", "d"))
reformat(factor(c("a", "c", "d", NA)), r)
```

The `NA` values are also not changed.
However, if we including reformatting for the `NA`, there is something different:

```{r}
r <- list(A = "a", B = c("c", "d"), C = NA)
reformat(factor(c("a", "c", "d", NA)), r)
```

Please note that the level for `NA` is always the last one, if that new level only has `NA`.

For `dm` objects, the `format` argument is actually a nested list of rules or **reformatting map**.
The first layer indicates the table names, the second layer indicates the variables in that table.
 
#### Example of Reformatting Map

```{r}
my_map <- list(
  # This is the Table Name.
  airlines = list(
    # This is the Variable Name.
    name = list(
      # This a variable Value.
      "AE" = c("American Airlines Inc."),
      "Alaska and Hawaiian Airlines" = c("Alaska Airlines Inc.", "Hawaiian Airlines Inc.")
    )
  ),
  planes = list(
    manufacturer = list(
      "Airbus" = "AIRBUS INDUSTRIE",
      "New Level" = "new_level",
      "<Missing>" = NA
    ),
    model = list(
      "EMB-145" = c("EMB-145XR"),
      "Other 737" = c("737-824", "737-724", "737-732")
    )
  )
)

db <- dm::dm_nycflights13()

db_formatted <- reformat(db, my_map)
head(db_formatted$planes$model)
```
