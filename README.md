`dunlin` provides a variety of data tools to reformat and manipulate a subset of the tables in a data set stored.

## Installation

### Clone and install manually

1. Clone the repository

1. Install `staged.dependencies` with

   ```r
   devtools::install_github("openpharma/staged.dependencies")
   ```

   and setup your GitHub tokens following the instructions on the `staged.dependencies` [website](https://github.com/openpharma/staged.dependencies).  Make sure that you enable SSO for the token.

1. Install the `dunlin` package dependencies with (make sure the working directory is set to the root of `dunlin`)

   ```r
   library(staged.dependencies)
      x <- dependency_table(
      project = "insightsengineering/dunlin",
      project_type = "repo@host",
      ref = "main",
      verbose = 1
   )

   install_deps(x, install_direction = "upstream", install_project = TRUE)
   ```

## Usage

  ```r
  library(dm)
  library(dunlin)
  
  db <- dm_nycflights13()
  
  new_carrier <- c(NA, "", as.character(db$airlines$carrier[-c(1, 2)]))
  new_name <- c(NA, "", as.character(db$airlines$name[-c(1, 2)]))
  
  db <- db %>%
    dm_zoom_to("airlines") %>%
    mutate(
      carrier = new_carrier,
      name = new_name
    ) %>%
    dm_update_zoomed()

  db$airlines
  ```
  
  which returns `airlines` as
  
  ```text
  # A tibble: 15 Ã— 2
     carrier name                         
     <chr>   <chr>                        
   1  NA      NA                          
   2 ""      ""                           
   3 "AS"    "Alaska Airlines Inc."       
   4 "B6"    "JetBlue Airways"            
   5 "DL"    "Delta Air Lines Inc."       
   6 "EV"    "ExpressJet Airlines Inc."   
   7 "F9"    "Frontier Airlines Inc."     
   8 "FL"    "AirTran Airways Corporation"
   9 "HA"    "Hawaiian Airlines Inc."     
  10 "MQ"    "Envoy Air"                  
  11 "UA"    "United Air Lines Inc."      
  12 "US"    "US Airways Inc."            
  13 "VX"    "Virgin America"             
  14 "WN"    "Southwest Airlines Co."     
  15 "YV"    "Mesa Airlines Inc."   
  ```
  
  ```r
  new_format <- list(
    airlines = list(
      carrier = rule("No Coding available" = c("", NA, "<Missing>")),
      name = rule("<Missing>" = c("", NA, "<Missing>"))
    )
  )
  
  db <- dunlin::reformat(db, new_format, na_last = TRUE)
  
  db$airlines
  ```
  
  which reformulates `airlines` as
  
  ```text
  # A tibble: 15 Ã— 2
     carrier             name                       
     <fct>               <fct>                      
   1 No Coding available <Missing>
