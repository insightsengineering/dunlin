# dunlin 0.1.7

* Rules specified under the `all_datasets` keyword in a format list will apply to every data set of the reformatted object unless specified otherwise.

# dunlin 0.1.6

* `render_safe` now renders placeholder using in priority values corresponding to the key matching exactly the placeholder, case included.
* New `show_whisker` function to display the available whiskers.
* `join_adsub_adsl` now sends a warning when the continuous or categorical variables are missing or all `NA`. All `NA` variables can now be kept using `drop_na = FALSE`. In addition, missing levels in the pivoted columns can be dropped with `drop_lvl = TRUE`.
* Remove `mini_pivot_wider` function which is no longer used.

# dunlin 0.1.5

* `empty_rule` is removed now. `rule()` will create a normal `rule` object.
* By default `rule` are converting empty space `""` to `NA` upon reformatting.
* `list2rule` now tolerates duplicated rules with different names.
* Specified minimal version of package dependencies.

# dunlin 0.1.4

* `rules` now have attributes controlling their behavior during reformatting.
* `reformat` can override `rule` attribute with the corresponding arguments.
* Add `render_safe` and `add_whisker` functions to replaces placeholders enclosed in curly braces with replacement stored in a dedicated environment.
* `read_rule` function has been moved into the `citril` package.

# dunlin 0.1.3

* Add `log_filter` function for filtering with additional logs.
* Remove the use of `dm`.
* Introduced `ls_explicit_na` to replace `NA` values in an entire `list` of `data.frame`.
* `reformat` re-levels factors to follow the order provided in the rule that is applied and levels declared in the rule are all integrated to the result.

# dunlin 0.1.2

* Defined a Reformatting Map (`rule` object) which specifies the correspondence between the old and the new values in data.
* Enhanced function `dunlin::reformat()` that provides generic supports in `character` and/or `factor` reformatting while keeping the attributes of the original data (e.g. the data type or labels) unchanged.
* Improved performance of package by adding more unit tests.
* Upgraded package dependencies and removed deprecated functions.
* Updated `pkgdown` configuration.

# dunlin 0.1.1

* Initial package release.
